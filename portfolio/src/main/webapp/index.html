      	      <p> Hi! My name is Kerry, and I am a STEP Intern and rising 3rd year at the University of Chicago, studying Computer Science. </p> 
     	      <p> I am from Elmhurst, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and am currently completing the remote internship there! I really enjoy sports, and am on the varsity lacrosse team at UChicago. I also used to play tennis, and still play it for fun whenever I can. Outside of sports, I love biking, and I try to go on several long bike rides a week. When Im just trying to chill, I tend to watch netflix, my most recent show being Money Heist. </p>

      <div id="Programming" class = "innercontent">
	      <p> I got into coding senior year of high school when I decided to take a Computer Science course offered by my school. We learned Java, and did a ton of interesting and fun projects, so it ended up being my favorite class of that year. I have been able to learn so much more through the programming courses I have taken so far in college, including C, and in my time helping develop CS curriculum for CPS through a non-profit, I was able to learn Python, HTML, and CSS. I've loved all the programming I've been able to do so far in my life, and am so excited to apply what I know and develop my skills further this summer! </p>  
              <p> Here is a list of some projects I have worked on: </p>
      	      <ul> 
		      <li> Created my own version of a linux shell </li>
	      	      <li> Coded the game Go </li>
	              <li> Developed curriculum on how to create a web application using flask and python </li>
	              <li> Created my own cersion of the Malloc function </li>
	              <li> Creaated a 2-way associative cache with LRU replacement </li>
              </ul>
