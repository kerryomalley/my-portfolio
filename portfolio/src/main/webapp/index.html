      <p> Hi! My name is Kerry, and I am a STEP Intern and rising 3rd year at the University of Chicago, studying Computer Science. </p> 
      <p> I am from Elmhurst, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and am currently completing the remote internship there! I really enjoy sports, and am on the varsity lacrosse team at UChicago. I also used to play tennis, and still play it for fun whenever I can. Outside of sports, I love biking, and I try to go on several long bike rides a week. When Im just trying to chill, I tend to watch netflix, my most recent show being Money Heist. </p> 
      <p> Here is a list of some projects I have worked on: </p>
      <ul> 
	      <li> Created my own version of a linux shell </li>
	      <li> Coded the game Go </li>
